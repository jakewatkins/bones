# Bones - not quite a skeleton

Bones is my idea of a tool to start new projects.  It will setup an initial project directory, add a .gitignore, .editorconfig and constitution file to your project along with resusable prompts to use as slash commands in github copilot.  Optionally it will setup Github's Spec-Kit for your project.

This isn't finished.  I started this project for a few reasons:
- I wanted a tool to start new projects with some basic resources I commonly use.
- I wanted to demonstrate how I work with AI coding assistants (copilot primarily)
- I want to learn how to create reusable prompts and this provides a way to load them in to projects.

I put this up with an MIT license - you're welcome to copy and make this your own.  I'd love to hear how you change it to suit your own needs and preferences.
